I want a highly interactive, pure HTML+JS+CSS, mobile first responsive prototype for following specifications.
Step 1: In the home page, there will be a banner. Below the banner, there shall be two links "Search By Location" and "Search By Developer"
Step2: On clicking search by Location, a map of Mumbai shall load in the div below the banner. The image name is mumbai-suburb-map.jpg, it will get loaded. Let the name of this div be "mumbai-map-div".
Step3: On click of a particular location in the map, the whole div (mumbai-map-div) shall disappear and a new div that was invisible so far shall appear.
This div, lets name it "suburb-div"  shall show 8 different place holders that will contain standard sizes vertical rectangular images, 8 in total.
On clicking the first image, the currently visible div ( suburb-div shall disappear and a new div by name "locality-div" shall appear.
This locality-div shall again have placeholder images, 10 in total. Again these all images will be vertical rectagular images. 
On clicking the any of the image in this div a text parameter shall pass in the link, the locality-div shall disapper and a new div by name "projects-div" shall appear. 
There shall be a title text in this div saying "Projects in" appended by the value of the text parametr passed with the click.
In this div also, there shall be vertical rectangular image place holders ( 8 in total).
On click of any of the images, again this "projects-div" shall disappear and a new div by name "project-details" div shall appaer. This div shall show one large image at a time
 and on click on ">>" symbol, place towards bottom right corner of the image, it shall show next large image.
Each image shall have a functionality where click on the ">>" symbol placed next to bottom right of the image shall show next large image and click on "<<" symbol placed near top left of the image shall show previous image.
Only the very first image in the projects div shall not have a "<<" symbol, because there is nothing to go bac to.
For each of the divs i.e, suburbs-div, locality-div, projects-div, and project-details-div shall have "<<Previous" printed on top left corner. A click on it shall make the current div disappear and previous div shall appear.
